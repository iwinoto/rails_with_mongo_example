This is an introductional tutorial with the intention of showing how to create a Rails 4 app with MongoDB, using Rspec and Cucumber for testing

The project has been modified for Bluemix deployment.
To deploy to Bluemix execute from the app root:

Update the host name in manifest.yml

# create the service as named in the manifest.yml

$ cf create-service mongodb 100 mongo-rails-sample

# push the application using the default manifest file (manifest.yml)

$ cf push

After a successful push the application will be available at:

   http://<your host name>.mybluemix.net/products
